    "changelog": "### Added\n\n* A file with the code for both snippets in the custom transforms documentation was added to the \"DocCodeSamples.Tests\" folder.\n* The Create Menu now offers ScriptTemplates for the IComponentData, ISystem, IJobEntity and Baker types under Assets/Create/Entities\n\n### Changed\n\n* Fixed infinite loop that could occur due to concurrent use of non-concurrent Dictionary in Aspect Generator.\n* Reduce the set/restore frequency of the fixed rate system group allocator.\n* Various performance improvements in baking. Baking mesh-heavy scenes now takes 70% of what it did before.\n* Significant performance improvements when creating archetypes and entity queries in Worlds with a large number of existing archetypes/queries.\n* Updated Burst dependency to version 1.8.12\n\n### Fixed\n\n* EntityQuery singleton methods now correctly handle cases where the query contains enableable components. Note that `GetSingletonEntity()` and `TryGetSingletonEntity()` still can not be used on queries with enableable components, and that the singleton component itself can not be enableable. Both constraints may be lifted in a future release.\n* A broken link to a code snippet in the documentation for custom transforms was fixed.\n* Archetype window and Entity Memory Profiler module UI initialization.\n* Making a player build with define `UNITY_DOTS_DEBUG`, while using an IJobEntity using RefRO/RefRW no longer compile errors!\n* Clarified documentation for cleanup components\n* Fixed minor memory leak in content delivery system.\n* AABB.Contains.\n* The entities hierarchy view would sometimes throw exceptions when entities were destroyed.\n* remove use of UNITY_64 define, as is can not be reliably used to determine 64 bit nature of platforms. Fixes crashes related to pointer truncation."
