# Introducing tag components

Tag Components are unmanaged components that store no data and take up no space. Conceptually, tag Components fulfil a similar purpose to [GameObject tags](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Tags.html) and they are useful in queries because you can filter entities by whether they have a tag Component. For example, you can use them alongside [cleanup components](components-cleanup.md) and filter entities to [perform cleanup](components-cleanup-cleanup.md).
