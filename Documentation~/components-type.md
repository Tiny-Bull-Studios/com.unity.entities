# Component types

To serve a variety of use cases, there are multiple types of ECS components. This section of the documentation describes the ECS component types, their use cases and performance considerations, as well as how to create them.

## Component types in the Editor

In the Editor, the following icons represent the different types of components. You can see these in relevant [Entities windows and Inspectors](editor-workflows.md).

| **Icon**                                 | **component type**   |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| ![](images/editor-managed-component.png) | A managed component. |
| ![](images/editor-shared-component.png)  | A shared component.  |
| ![](images/editor-tag-component.png)     | A tag component.     |
| ![](images/editor-buffer-component.png)  | A buffer component.  |
| ![](images/editor-chunk-component.png)   | A chunk component.   |

> [!NOTE]
> Unity uses a generic component icon for components types not in the above list.
